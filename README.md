Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahdee (Marty) â€“ Azure Cloud Architect
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a skilled Azure Cloud Architect with expertise in designing, implementing, and optimizing cloud-based solutions. I specialize in crafting scalable, secure, and high-performance architectures tailored to meet diverse business needs.

What I Bring to the Table:
Proficient in Azure services, including DevOps, App Services, Kubernetes, and more.
Strong background in cloud-native development, microservices, and CI/CD pipelines.
Passionate about automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and delivering efficient, cost-effective solutions.
Experienced in guiding teams through cloud migration and modernization projects.
Beyond the Cloud:
I'm also enthusiastic about sharing knowledge, contributing to open-source projects, and staying on the cutting edge of cloud technology trends.
